# Operating Systems laboratory
This repository contains tasks completed as part of the "Operating Systems" course. As part of the tasks, I created simulations and implemented:

- A CPU scheduling algorithm for processes
- A disk scheduling algorithm
- A page replacement algorithm
- A simulation of a distributed load-balancing algorithm for processors.
